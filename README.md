# Satellite Star Surveyor

Satellite Star Surveyor is a Python simulation project for autonomous space telescope pointing, target selection, state estimation, and attitude control. The project combines a high-level observation planner, spacecraft attitude guidance, nonlinear state estimation, and Model Predictive Control (MPC) to simulate a telescope in orbit selecting stars, slewing toward targets, stabilizing, and collecting observation time.

The system is designed around a closed-loop workflow:

1. Select a feasible star target based on Sun and Earth keepout constraints.
2. Generate a desired spacecraft attitude that points the telescope boresight at the selected target.
3. Estimate the spacecraft state using simulated sensor measurements.
4. Use MPC to compute torque commands for attitude control.
5. Propagate spacecraft dynamics and visualize the resulting mission behavior.

## Core Components

### Star Planner

The star planner is responsible for deciding what the spacecraft should observe next. Targets are provided as a table containing right ascension, declination, and required observation time. The planner converts the target directions into inertial unit vectors, checks whether each target is feasible, and selects the best unfinished target.

A target is considered feasible when:

* It is outside the Earth exclusion region.
* It is farther than the Sun keepout angle.
* It still has remaining required observation time.

Planner modes:

| Mode        | Description                                                                         |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NO_TARGET` | No currently feasible unfinished target is available.                               |
| `SLEWING`   | The spacecraft is rotating toward the selected target.                              |
| `SETTLING`  | The spacecraft is close to the target but still stabilizing.                        |
| `OBSERVING` | The spacecraft is accurately pointed and stable enough to collect observation time. |

### Guidance

The guidance layer connects target planning to attitude control. It takes the selected target direction and produces a desired rotation state for the spacecraft. The telescope boresight is aligned with the target while respecting environmental constraints such as Sun avoidance.

The guidance system also generates attitude goals that are compatible with the MPC's safety constraints. Rather than simply commanding the shortest rotational path to a target, the guidance layer must ensure that the resulting attitude trajectory remains feasible with respect to Sun exclusion requirements and spacecraft pointing limitations.

### Model Predictive Control

The MPC controller computes torque commands for the spacecraft attitude system. It formulates a finite-horizon optimization problem in error coordinates and solves it using Drake and OSQP.

The controller supports:

* Quaternion attitude states.
* Angular velocity tracking.
* State and control quadratic costs.
* Terminal costs.
* Control bounds.
* Warm-started optimization.
* Linearized error dynamics over the prediction horizon.
* Time-varying dynamics constraints generated from successive linearizations.
* Sun keepout constraints enforced throughout the prediction horizon.

At each control update, the controller solves for a sequence of future torque commands and applies only the first command.

### MEKF State Estimation

The Multiplicative Extended Kalman Filter estimates spacecraft state using simulated sensor data. It propagates the nominal state with IMU and gyro data, then corrects it with optional GNSS and star tracker measurements.

The filter estimates:

* Position
* Velocity
* Attitude quaternion
* Angular velocity
* Gyroscope bias
* Accelerometer bias

The MEKF uses a 15-dimensional error state:

```text
[position error, velocity error, attitude error, gyro bias error, accel bias error]
```

### Closed-Loop Simulation

The closed-loop simulation ties the whole project together. It includes:

* Spacecraft rigid-body dynamics
* Gravity and disturbance torques
* Sensor bias evolution
* State estimation
* Star target planning
* Attitude guidance
* MPC torque control
* Simulation clocking
* Structured logging

The main reusable API is built around `run_closed_loop_test`, which returns a `ClosedLoopTestResult`. The result can be converted into arrays or a pandas DataFrame for plotting, analysis, or visualization.

## Target Format

The planner expects a pandas DataFrame with the following columns:

| Column         | Description                                          |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `req_obs_time` | Required observation time for the target, in seconds |
| `Dec`          | Declination, in radians                              |
| `RA`           | Right ascension, in radians                          |

Example:

```python
import pandas as pd

targets = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "req_obs_time": [20.0, 20.0, 20.0],
        "Dec": [0.174533, -0.349066, 0.610865],
        "RA": [0.261799, 1.396263, 2.530727],
